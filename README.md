# Identifying_Numbers_With_Machine_Learning
This project is intended to gain familiarity with ML algorithms, specifically Neural networks.  Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM). It uses the well known identifying numbers problem as a starting point for neural networks. A trained model for MLP, CNN and LTSM all exist in this repo with the intention of comparing the differences.

# Quickstart Guide
1. Clone the repo to your instance.
2. Create a virtual environment and the install the requirements:
```
python3 -m venv .env
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
